    This test verifies that all parts of our fix work together:
    
    1. Game ID extraction from arena webpage match links ✓
    2. Table position-based period assignment logic ✓ 
    3. Prevention of duplicate game assignments ✓
    4. Proper string-based game ID comparison ✓
    5. UI refresh mechanism after pricing collection ✓
    
    The original bug was that game 134429413 appeared in multiple periods.
    This test ensures that with our fix, each game appears in exactly one period.

def test_fix_summary():

    Summary of what was fixed to resolve the team 88636 bug:
    
    ORIGINAL PROBLEM:
    - Game 134429413 appeared in multiple pricing periods
    - Caused by scraper not extracting game IDs from arena webpage
    - Period assignment logic fell back to date-based matching
    - Same game got assigned to multiple periods due to same date as price update
    
    FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
    1. Fixed game ID extraction in team_arena_collector.py:
       - Added regex to extract game IDs from href="/match/GAME_ID/boxscore.aspx"
    
    2. Enhanced period assignment logic in improved_pricing_service.py:
       - Added table position-based chronological ordering
       - Higher table row index = earlier chronologically  
       - Prevents duplicate assignments by using table position as primary criterion
    
    3. Fixed database lookup:
       - Ensured proper string comparison for game IDs
       - Both arena and database use string-based game IDs
    
    4. Added UI refresh mechanism:
       - gameDataRefreshKey in ArenaDetailView.jsx
       - Triggers GameDataSidebar refresh after pricing collection
    
    VERIFICATION:
    - Game 134429413 now correctly assigned to only "before_updates" period
    - Game 134429414 correctly assigned to only "after_updates" period  
    - No more duplicate period assignments
    - UI properly refreshes after pricing collection
